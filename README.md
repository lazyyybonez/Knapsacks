# Knapsacks
## Goals
The goal of this research is to study the time complexities of solutions to the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that, given a set of items that have a weight and value, it is possible to determine the most valuable combination of the items given a limit (max weight the knapsack can hold). Some every day applications of knapsacks includes loading cargo ships, packing for trips, choosing fantasy sport teams, encrypting messages, and so on.

## Implementation
The solution to the problem that this repository includes in the dynamic solution. In the file "knapsack_packages.txt" have the first line the max weight and max height separated by a space. Starting on the next line place the item name, weight, and value all separated by a space. Each item starts on a new line.

## Time Complexity
O(nW) where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of knapsack

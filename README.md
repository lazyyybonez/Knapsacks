# Cosc320-Knapsacks
## Goals
My research project includes the study of time complexities of solutions to the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that, given a set of items that have a weight and value, it is possible to determine the most valuable combination of the items given a limit (max weight the knapsack can hold). Some every day applications of knapsacks includes loading cargo ships, packing for trips, choosing fantasy sport teams, encrypting messages, and so on.
